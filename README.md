# ProblemSolving-8
A console-based C++ bank management system that supports secure login, role-based access control, and persistent storage using flat files. 
It enables full client lifecycle management (create, read, update, delete, and search), transaction operations (deposit, withdrawal), and aggregate balance reporting.
The system also includes user administration with configurable permissions, ensuring administrative control over who can perform sensitive actions. 
Data is stored in simple text records for portability and easy inspection, making the project a clean demonstration of structured programming, file I/O, and menu-driven CLI design.
